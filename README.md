# A CM4-Nano-C based Flask security cam 

Streams, records video, and takes a picture with Picamera2 using a Raspi Compute Module 4 with a Waveshare CM4-Nano-C noir camera base board.


This is based off of [allphasepi's work](https://github.com/allphasepi/Webcam/tree/main) which is based off [KarasuY's article](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/issues/844).



## Every instance where cm4 exist in a file path will need to be changed to your pi's user name unless you set it to cm4. 



## This has only been tested on RaspberryPi OS legacy Bullseye 32bit using a 4gb wireless no-emmc Raspi Compute Module 4.

For the case, I had to cut off the bit that sticks out on the bottom half because it interfered with the wireless antennae. I also had to use screws to screw the two halves together because my pla print did not clip well.
