The imx219.json is the modified whitepoint tuning file with a reduced blackpoint so the camera feed doesn't look bad bad in low lighting. If you want to use an unmodified whitepoint file, rename the imx219_noir_default.json to imx219.json and place it in the /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4/ directory
